# Employee Polls Project

## Quick Start ðŸš€

Visit the live app here: https://emloyeepools.netlify.app

This is the code for the final assessment project for Udacity's React & Redux course.

This project was bootstraped with Create React App and Redux.

The Employee Polls app is an interactive web application that allows users to create, vote on, and view the results of various polls within a workplace environment. Users can log in as existing employees, view unanswered and answered polls, and navigate between different sections such as creating new polls and viewing a leaderboard of employee engagement.

## Data

The `_DATA.js` file represents a fake database and methods that let you access the data.

There are two types of objects stored in our database:

- Users
- Questions
